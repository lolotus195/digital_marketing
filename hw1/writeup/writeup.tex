% Note this CDF plot is for customers that did spend at least something

% Again, this is for actual customers that spent something.
% we might want to only include the histogram or cdf.

\section{K-Means Matching (WC)}

Yes. We would use the new DMP. A regression of spend against the explanatory variables shows that the new ecom\_index variable is statistically significant. Moreover, the retail\_index variable is no longer statistically significant after we control for ecom\_index. Therefore, the new DMP provides a variable that allows us to obtain better matches than our original method.

As shown in the chart below, we can obtain a higher maximum profit under the new DMP than under our original method. Under the new DMP, profit is maximized at \$4,413.61 whereas the maximum profit under the old method was \$3,559.14. In both cases, profit is maximized when k-nearest neighbors are set to 3. See \vref{fig:profits}.
